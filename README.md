   - `-C`: decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into readable names
   - The `less` command is for viewing the contents of the file, allow both forward and backward navigation. (The `more` command only allow forward navigation.)
   - Can also use `grep` to get specific data.
   - When using `less` to view the file, you can use `/<anything_you_want_to_search>` to search for specific strings. For example, use `/main` to locate the main function.
   - Reference: [manual](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/objdump.html)

12. **`gdb ./<executable_program>`: The GNU Project Debugger.**
    - Install: `sudo apt-get update` then `sudo apt-get install gdb`.
    - Common commands in the gdb console:
      - `r`: run the program until next breakpoint or error
      - `c`: continue running the program
      - `f`: run the program until current function is finished
      - `s`: step to the next line of the program
        `n`: step to the next line of the program, but does not step into functions
      - `b main`: set breakpoint at the main function
      - `d`: delete all breakpoints
      - `jump *main+135`: jump to the address of the main function address with offset 135

      - `vmmap`: print out the memory address mapping to libraries and also the rwx (read, write, execute) permissions.
      - `q`: quit gdb
    - Tips: Keep an eye on the `cmp` (compare) statement when looking at the assembly code because usually if you can pass the compare statement, you can guess the correct input of the program.
      - To bypass `cmp` statements, you can either modify the register value to the desired one or jump to the next memory address right after the `cmp` statement.
    - Reference: [Official Website](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)
13. **`nc <ip> <port>`: Connect to remote server**
    - nc stands for [Netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat)

14. **`checksec ./<executable_binary>`: Check the security properties of a program**

    - Properties checked:
      - **`Arch`: The architecture of the program.**
        - For example, `amd64-64-little` means AMD64 architecture that uses little endian.
      - **`RELRO`: Is partial or full binary sections read-only?**
        - RELRO: [Relocation Read-Only](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/relocation-read-only/)
        - If full, "GOT([Global Offset Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Offset_Table)) overwrite" attack is not possible.
      - **`STACK`: Does stack canary exist?**
        - It is a technique to detect stack overflow by placing a number (named canary) before the stack return pointer, and check if the value has been changed.
        - Reference: [CTF Wiki](https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/mitigation/canary/)
      - **`NX`: Is NX protection enabled?**
        - NX: [No eXecute](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/no-execute/)
        - If yes, we cannot use stack overflow to execute our customized shellcodes.
      - **`PIE`: Prevents attackers by randomizing the memory address of the executable.**
        - PIE: [Position Independent Executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code#Position-independent_executables)
        - If enabled, we won't know the memory address until we run the program. Solution: Disable ASLR ([Address Space Layout Randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization)) on our OS to let the addresses remain the same.
        - How to disable ASLR on Linux: [StackOverflow](https://askubuntu.com/questions/318315/how-can-i-temporarily-disable-aslr-address-space-layout-randomization)

      - `: some_command`: enter commands in visual mode
      - `q`: return to the previous mode / quit
16. **`gcc test.c -fno-stack-protector -o test`: Compile C code to executable with disabled canary protection**
    - By disabling canary protection, the program is subjected to BOF ([Buffer Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow)) attack.
    - Usually, if you see `Segmentation fault` after a very long input, it has BOF vulnerability.
17. **`file <filename>`: Prints out the type of the file.**
    - Useful when you are not sure about the file type. For instance, an image file without a .jpg.
18. **`openssl rsa -pubin -in <path_to_public_key> -text -noout`: Find modulus from a RSA public key**
    - `-pubin`: read the public key instead of private key (private key is read by default if not specified)
    - `-in`: specify the input file
    - `-text`: print the public / private key in plaintext
    - `-noout`: prevent printing the encoded version of the key

```python
from pwn import *

# remember to change the values here
HOST = "<ip.address>"
PORT = <port_number>

# connect to the remote server and define our value to send
r = remote(HOST, PORT)
# For reading local binaries:
# r = process('./<executable_binary>')

something_to_send = 0xfaceb00c

# Usually there is a newline before the user input, so receive until '\n'
r.recvuntil('\n')

# stop and listen to user input in the console, press enter to continue
raw_input()

r.sendline(p32(something_to_send))
# use r.send() to send without a new line
# use p32 to encode the hex value as 32-bit char and p64 for 64-bit char

# enter the interactive console
r.interactive()
```

3. **[Angr](https://github.com/angr/angr): A collection of binary analysis tools**

```python
import angr
import claripy # Angr's constraint solver engine

# replace this with the binary you want to analyze
# disable auto_load_libs to improve performance
project = angr.Project("./<binary>", auto_load_libs=False)

# create a symbolic object with 25 bytes
# BV stands for BitVector (bit array)
argv1 = claripy.BVS("argv1", 25*8)

# specify the entry point of the program and our input parameter
initial_state = project.factory.entry_state(args=["./<binary>", argv1])

# generate a simulation manager object for solving our parameter later
sm = project.factory.simulation_manager(initial_state)

# symbolically execute until we find a state with address = find_addr
find_addr = 0x400602
sm.explore(find=find_addr)

# find the state that meets the above condition
found = sm.found[0]

# return the input value to get to this state and cast it to bytes
solution = found.solver.eval(argv1, cast_to=bytes)

# repr: returns a printable representation of the input object
print(repr(solution))
```

x, y, z = Reals('x y z') # real numbers

# add constraints
s = Solver()
s.add(x > 1, y > 1, x + y > 3, z - x < 10)

# check if the constraints can be satisfied (output: sat / unsat)
print(s.check())

# use model to specify multiple constraints and make each of them true
